## what is electromyography? 

Because our muscles repolarize and depolarize, just like brain neurons, our muscles generate action potention. Whenever the signal comes in, the muscle cell membrain rapidly depolarize and then slowly repolarize. Its cell membrane action potential changes from -70mv to 20mv, then slowly repolarizes back to -70mv, using ATP.

Electromyography detects such small electrical changes in muscle and amplifies those signals. Those amplified analog signals then could be read through Analog to Ditigal Comparator of ESP32 board.
